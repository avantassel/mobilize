# Mobilize

Organizes disaster relief and recovery aid.  

Mobilize does a few things:
1. Helps shelters staff for volunteers.
2. Captures needs and issues of victims in affected disaster areas.
3. Keeps disaster victims notified of relief efforts.

Mobilize was developed for the IBM [Bluemixathon](http://bluemixathon.devpost.com/)
